# PySiMMMulator
PySiMMMulator is an open source Python adaption of the R-package [siMMMulator](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/siMMMulator), allows users to generate simulated data to use in testing Marketing Mix Models (MMMs).
While this package cointains a full pipeline for data generation (configurable via .conf file) it can also be utilized in parts to generate select portions of MMM input data (ie campaign/channel spend)
